# What is this?
A hand-curated, living document aiming to capture the vast space of creative development.
Creative Development is an all-encompassing term. As such, the resources here reflect the nature of creative dev work.
Topics includes animations, shaders, maths, etc... Though not explicitly language-agnostic, specific languages/frameworks (e.g. Three.js, Godot, Babylon.js) are also included. 
Both free and paid courses will be included. Currently adding these as I export from my bookmarks. Goal is to have these sorted from lowest to highest cost (hopefully updated regularly to reflect long-term price changes).
